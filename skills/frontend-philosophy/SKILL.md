  Frontend design philosophy and coding conventions for React/Preact applications.
  Enforces DHH-inspired simplicity, 8-section component structure, TanStack Query
  server state management, and strict anti-patterns (no useCallback, no useEffect
  for state sync, no barrel files, no TypeScript). Use when: (1) scaffolding new
  frontend projects, (2) building React/Preact components, (3) implementing features
  with state management, (4) reviewing or refactoring frontend code, (5) setting up
  project structure and file organization. Triggers on: "scaffold", "new project",
  "build a component", "create a page", "add a feature", "frontend", "React",
  "Preact", or any frontend implementation task.

# Frontend Philosophy

Authoritative conventions for all React/Preact work. These are not suggestions — they are the standard. When in doubt, choose the simpler path.

> "Every line of code is a liability. The best code is no code. The second best is simple, boring code that obviously works."

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity over cleverness** — Write code a junior dev understands
2. **Convention over configuration** — Follow existing patterns, don't invent
3. **Optimize for understanding** — Code is read 10x more than written
4. **Embrace the monolith** — Colocate related concerns, don't split prematurely
5. **Performance through simplicity** — Fastest code is code that doesn't run

## Stack Defaults

| Purpose | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Runtime/pkg | Bun | Fallback: npm. Never pnpm/yarn |
| Bundler | Vite | With `@/` path alias |
| Framework | React or Preact | + TanStack Query/Router |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, `cn()` for merging |
| UI primitives | shadcn/ui pattern | CVA for variants, Radix primitives |
| Server state | TanStack Query | ONLY source of truth for API data |
| Client state | Zustand or Preact Signals | UI state only (modals, theme, filters) |
| Icons | @remixicon/react | `Ri*Line` for outline, `Ri*Fill` for solid |
| Types | **No TypeScript** | `.jsx` components, `.js` utilities |

### Why No TypeScript

Speed over ceremony. Type gymnastics add grief, not joy. Runtime validation at system boundaries, shared constants, JSDoc for complex functions.

## File Conventions

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Base UI (shadcn pattern)
│   ├── billing/         # Feature-based grouping
│   ├── support/         # NOT type-based (lists/, forms/, displays/)
│   └── common/          # Shared across features
├── hooks/               # Custom hooks (use* prefix)
├── stores/              # Zustand stores
├── constants/           # Shared constants
├── lib/                 # Utilities (cn, formatters)
├── pages/               # Route-level components
└── api/                 # API client
```

**Naming rules:**
- `.jsx` components, `.js` utilities — always
- PascalCase component files, camelCase everything else
- `handle*` event handlers, `use*` hooks, `render*` render methods
- Feature-based folders, never type-based
- **No barrel files** (index.ts/js re-exports) — ever
- **No comments** unless logic is truly non-obvious

## Component Structure (8 Sections)

Every component follows this order. See [references/component-patterns.md](references/component-patterns.md) for full examples.

```jsx
const Component = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // 1. Server state (TanStack Query)
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({ ... });

  // 2. Global client state (Zustand/signals)
  const { theme } = useThemeStore();

  // 3. Local state (useState)
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  // 4. Refs
  const formRef = useRef(null);

  // 5. Custom hooks
  const { isOnline } = useNetworkStatus();

  // 6. Derived values (compute in render, no useState)
  const isValid = email.includes("@");
  const fullName = `${data?.first} ${data?.last}`;

  // 7. Effects (DOM sync, subscriptions, analytics ONLY)
  useEffect(() => { ... }, [deps]);

  // 8. Event handlers
  const handleSubmit = () => { ... };

  // Return — early returns for loading/error first
  if (isLoading) return <Skeleton />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;

  return ( ... );
};
```

## State Management Rules

### Server State = TanStack Query ONLY

```jsx
// CORRECT — single source of truth
const { data: users } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["users", filters],
  queryFn: () => api.get("/users", { params: filters }),
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
  gcTime: 60 * 60 * 1000,    // NOT cacheTime (v5)
});

// WRONG — duplicating server data in local state
const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
useEffect(() => { fetchUsers().then(setUsers); }, []);
```

### Client State = Zustand or Signals

Only for UI concerns: modals, theme, sidebar, filters, form inputs.

### Derive, Don't Duplicate

```jsx
// CORRECT — derive in render
const hasError = error !== null;
const activeUsers = users?.filter(u => u.isActive);

// WRONG — useState for derived values
const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setHasError(error !== null), [error]);
```

### Data Fetching Hierarchy

1. **Pages** fetch all required data
2. **Pass data as props** to children
3. **Never refetch in children** when parent has the data

## Critical Anti-Patterns

These are **hard rules**, not guidelines.

| NEVER do this | Do this instead |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `useEffect` for state sync | Move logic to event handlers |
| `useCallback` | Just define the function (almost never needed) |
| `useState` for derived values | Compute in render |
| Duplicate server data in useState | TanStack Query is the source of truth |
| Barrel files (index.ts re-exports) | Import directly from the file |
| `useMemo` without profiling first | Just compute it |
| Prop drilling beyond 2 levels | Composition or Zustand |
| Business logic in components | Extract to hooks or utilities |
| Multiple state management libs | TanStack Query + ONE client state lib |
| Inline styles or global CSS | Tailwind utilities |
| Premature abstraction | Rule of 3 — wait for 3+ use cases |
| Custom wrappers around libraries | Use the library directly |
| Over-commenting | Self-documenting names |

### Valid useEffect Uses

Only three:
1. **DOM synchronization** (focus, scroll, resize listeners)
2. **External subscriptions** (WebSocket, event emitters)
3. **Analytics/logging** (page views, tracking)

Everything else belongs in an event handler or TanStack Query.

## Formatting

Prettier defaults:
- 2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons
- 100 char print width, trailing commas ES5
- Tailwind plugin for class ordering

## UI Patterns

- Buttons: always `rounded-full`
- Cards: always `rounded-xl`
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for class merging
- Use CVA (class-variance-authority) for component variants
- Composition over configuration — build with children and slots
- `data-slot` attributes for CSS targeting
- Early returns for loading/error states before main render

## Code Review Questions

Before shipping, ask:
1. Can a junior dev understand this?
2. Is this the simplest solution that works?
3. Does this follow existing patterns in the codebase?
4. Is the complexity justified by real requirements?
5. Will this be maintainable in 6 months?
