This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

## Rules

### Accessibility

- Icon-only buttons need `aria-label`
- Form controls need `<label>` or `aria-label`
- Interactive elements need keyboard handlers (`onKeyDown`/`onKeyUp`)
- `<button>` for actions, `<a>`/`<Link>` for navigation (not `<div onClick>`)
- Images need `alt` (or `alt=""` if decorative)
- Decorative icons need `aria-hidden="true"`
- Async updates (toasts, validation) need `aria-live="polite"`
- Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<label>`, `<table>`) before ARIA
- Headings hierarchical `<h1>`–`<h6>`; include skip link for main content
- `scroll-margin-top` on heading anchors

### Focus States

- Interactive elements need visible focus: `focus-visible:ring-*` or equivalent
- Never `outline-none` / `outline: none` without focus replacement
- Use `:focus-visible` over `:focus` (avoid focus ring on click)
- Group focus with `:focus-within` for compound controls

### Forms

- Inputs need `autocomplete` and meaningful `name`
- Use correct `type` (`email`, `tel`, `url`, `number`) and `inputmode`
- Never block paste (`onPaste` + `preventDefault`)
- Labels clickable (`htmlFor` or wrapping control)
- Disable spellcheck on emails, codes, usernames (`spellCheck={false}`)
- Checkboxes/radios: label + control share single hit target (no dead zones)
- Submit button stays enabled until request starts; spinner during request
- Errors inline next to fields; focus first error on submit
- Placeholders end with `…` and show example pattern
- `autocomplete="off"` on non-auth fields to avoid password manager triggers
- Warn before navigation with unsaved changes (`beforeunload` or router guard)

### Animation

- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (provide reduced variant or disable)
- Animate `transform`/`opacity` only (compositor-friendly)
- Never `transition: all`—list properties explicitly
- Set correct `transform-origin`
- SVG: transforms on `<g>` wrapper with `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center`
- Animations interruptible—respond to user input mid-animation

### Typography

- `…` not `...`
- Curly quotes `"` `"` not straight `"`
- Non-breaking spaces: `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘&nbsp;K`, brand names
- Loading states end with `…`: `"Loading…"`, `"Saving…"`
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for number columns/comparisons
- Use `text-wrap: balance` or `text-pretty` on headings (prevents widows)

### Content Handling

- Text containers handle long content: `truncate`, `line-clamp-*`, or `break-words`
- Flex children need `min-w-0` to allow text truncation
- Handle empty states—don't render broken UI for empty strings/arrays
- User-generated content: anticipate short, average, and very long inputs

### Images

- `<img>` needs explicit `width` and `height` (prevents CLS)
- Below-fold images: `loading="lazy"`
- Above-fold critical images: `priority` or `fetchpriority="high"`

### Performance

- Large lists (>50 items): virtualize (`virtua`, `content-visibility: auto`)
- No layout reads in render (`getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetHeight`, `offsetWidth`, `scrollTop`)
- Batch DOM reads/writes; avoid interleaving
- Prefer uncontrolled inputs; controlled inputs must be cheap per keystroke
- Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for CDN/asset domains
- Critical fonts: `<link rel="preload" as="font">` with `font-display: swap`

### Navigation & State

- URL reflects state—filters, tabs, pagination, expanded panels in query params
- Links use `<a>`/`<Link>` (Cmd/Ctrl+click, middle-click support)
- Deep-link all stateful UI (if uses `useState`, consider URL sync via nuqs or similar)
- Destructive actions need confirmation modal or undo window—never immediate

### Touch & Interaction

- `touch-action: manipulation` (prevents double-tap zoom delay)
- `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` set intentionally
- `overscroll-behavior: contain` in modals/drawers/sheets
- During drag: disable text selection, `inert` on dragged elements
- `autoFocus` sparingly—desktop only, single primary input; avoid on mobile

### Safe Areas & Layout

- Full-bleed layouts need `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notches
- Avoid unwanted scrollbars: `overflow-x-hidden` on containers, fix content overflow
- Flex/grid over JS measurement for layout

### Dark Mode & Theming

- `color-scheme: dark` on `<html>` for dark themes (fixes scrollbar, inputs)
- `<meta name="theme-color">` matches page background
- Native `<select>`: explicit `background-color` and `color` (Windows dark mode)

### Locale & i18n

- Dates/times: use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` not hardcoded formats
- Numbers/currency: use `Intl.NumberFormat` not hardcoded formats
- Detect language via `Accept-Language` / `navigator.languages`, not IP

### Hydration Safety

- Inputs with `value` need `onChange` (or use `defaultValue` for uncontrolled)
- Date/time rendering: guard against hydration mismatch (server vs client)
- `suppressHydrationWarning` only where truly needed

### Hover & Interactive States

- Buttons/links need `hover:` state (visual feedback)
- Interactive states increase contrast: hover/active/focus more prominent than rest

### Content & Copy

- Active voice: "Install the CLI" not "The CLI will be installed"
- Title Case for headings/buttons (Chicago style)
- Numerals for counts: "8 deployments" not "eight"
- Specific button labels: "Save API Key" not "Continue"
- Error messages include fix/next step, not just problem
- Second person; avoid first person
- `&` over "and" where space-constrained

### Anti-patterns (flag these)

- `user-scalable=no` or `maximum-scale=1` disabling zoom
- `onPaste` with `preventDefault`
- `transition: all`
- `outline-none` without focus-visible replacement
- Inline `onClick` navigation without `<a>`
- `<div>` or `<span>` with click handlers (should be `<button>`)
- Images without dimensions
- Large arrays `.map()` without virtualization
- Form inputs without labels
- Icon buttons without `aria-label`
- Hardcoded date/number formats (use `Intl.*`)
- `autoFocus` without clear justification

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific with keywords** - "healthcare SaaS dashboard" > "app"
2. **Search multiple times** - Different keywords reveal different insights
3. **Combine domains** - Style + Typography + Color = Complete design system
4. **Always check UX** - Search "animation", "z-index", "accessibility" for common issues
5. **Use stack flag** - Get implementation-specific best practices
6. **Iterate** - If first search doesn't match, try different keywords

## Common Rules for Professional UI

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional:

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule                       | Do                                              | Don't                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **No emoji icons**         | Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons) | Use emojis like 🎨 🚀 ⚙️ as UI icons      |
| **Stable hover states**    | Use color/opacity transitions on hover          | Use scale transforms that shift layout |
| **Correct brand logos**    | Research official SVG from Simple Icons         | Guess or use incorrect logo paths      |
| **Consistent icon sizing** | Use fixed viewBox (24x24) with w-6 h-6          | Mix different icon sizes randomly      |

### Interaction & Cursor

| Rule                   | Do                                                    | Don't                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cursor pointer**     | Add `cursor-pointer` to all clickable/hoverable cards | Leave default cursor on interactive elements |
| **Hover feedback**     | Provide visual feedback (color, shadow, border)       | No indication element is interactive         |
| **Smooth transitions** | Use `transition-colors duration-200`                  | Instant state changes or too slow (>500ms)   |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Rule                      | Do                                  | Don't                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Glass card light mode** | Use `bg-white/80` or higher opacity | Use `bg-white/10` (too transparent)     |
| **Text contrast light**   | Use `#0F172A` (slate-900) for text  | Use `#94A3B8` (slate-400) for body text |
| **Muted text light**      | Use `#475569` (slate-600) minimum   | Use gray-400 or lighter                 |
| **Border visibility**     | Use `border-gray-200` in light mode | Use `border-white/10` (invisible)       |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule                     | Do                                  | Don't                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Floating navbar**      | Add `top-4 left-4 right-4` spacing  | Stick navbar to `top-0 left-0 right-0` |
| **Content padding**      | Account for fixed navbar height     | Let content hide behind fixed elements |
| **Consistent max-width** | Use same `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl` | Mix different container widths         |
